## Thermostat Challenge

This is a project that has been conducted in Javascript. The testing framework for it is jasmine.

In this project, a single page application has been defined in which you can use the buttons to set the temperature of a room by a thermostat.

The thermostat works by the following criteria:

1. You can set the temperature of the room by + and - buttons.
2. The minimum temperature accessible is 10 degrees.

3. You can make the power safe mode on or off by "PSM on" and "PSM off" buttons.

If the power safe mode is on, the maximum accessible degree in 25 degrees.

If the power safe mode is off, the maximum accessible degree is 32 degrees.

4. You can reset the thermostat and the degree will be 20 degrees.

5. You can understand the current temperature of your city by choosing your city's name and the weather temperature is achieved by calling the openweathermap API.
``` http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather? ```
